# Sports-Classification

Overview
This repository contains an AI model for sports classification based on image recognition. Leveraging deep learning techniques, this project aims to accurately identify various sports from images.

Features
Image Classification: Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify sports based on uploaded images.
Multi-Class Classification: Capable of recognizing a wide range of sports categories.

Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow/Keras
CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)

Usage
Ensure proper installation of dependencies and models before running the classification script.
Follow the guidelines provided in the code comments and documentation for optimal performance.
Feel free to experiment with different images and sports categories to test the model's accuracy.
